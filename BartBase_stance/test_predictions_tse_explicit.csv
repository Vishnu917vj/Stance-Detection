it is not 'appropriate' to teach creationism as a means for upholding the bible.,AGAINST,"It is not 'appropriate' to teach creationism as a means for upholding the bible. This pre-supposes that the bible should be upheld in a literal sense. Many Christians object to this. More importantly, governments should not be in the business of upholding the Bible.

The Bible doesn't stand or fall on that statement. Creationism doesn't stand or fall on that statement. God did not create the world in six days, but he did never the less, create it.",creationism,AGAINST
allowing creationism in schools would violate the separation of church and state. a separation of,AGAINST," Allowing creationism in schools would violate the separation of church and state A separation of Church and state necessitates that public schools not be a forum for upholding the validity or truth of certain faiths. This does not necessarily mean that Christian faith and ""creationism"" should not be taught as subjects of interest in public schools.

The macro level of evolution has a long way to go to provide proof, but there is enough work going on in this subject that links can eventually be found.  Creationism is also a theory based on faith, yes there are some historical evidence of links to the stories within the Bible, but that only proves that the Bible has some historical value and does not prove the Creationism theory.",creationism,FAVOR

Some creationists have argued that 'creationism' is a theory consistent with the scientific method. The hypothesis it adopts is that God created 'the heaven and earth ...' some thousands of years ago, and that man did not ""evolve"" into his current state. Supporters of Creationism then cite supporting evidence for this theory.

Any reason he believes this to be so? It is hard to refute an argument that states ungrounded opinion as fact, but even harder to take it seriously.

attempts to conceal the creationism-evolution controversy from students are dogmatic promotions,FAVOR,"Attempts to conceal the creationism-evolution controversy from students are dogmatic promotions of evolution. Not since blasphemy laws has competitive expression of thought been illegalized, and this is what evolutionists want to accomplish. This is evidenced by none other than the title of an evolutionist argument on this very page: ""Schools should not teach theories that are completely at odds with each other""

Just because some smart people who believe in evolution are outnumbered by an army of morons who believe in creationism, doesn't give creationism any more validity. Those who believe in creationism when there is clear, scientific evidence against it are either ignorant to the theory of evolution or stupid.

Other than that, the only source for creationism is the creation story in the Bible.

it's called the theory of evolution for a reason. do you know why? because it,FAVOR,"It's called the THEORY of evolution for a reason. Do you know why? Because it's not the LAW of evolution because it has no proof! Even IF evolution was truth(which it isn't) it doesn't proove against intelligent design. Intelligent design constitutes that something created the universe; Aithiesm constitutes that NOTHING created the universe.Personally, I believe that the earth and universe was created in six literal days, and evolution has no more proof than creationism IMHO",creationism,AGAINST
evolution is an observable fact - while creationists often attempt to describe evolution as merely a,AGAINST," Evolution is an observable fact - While creationists often attempt to describe evolution as merely a theory, this is not exactly the case. Observations that evolution does occur in nature makes the process of evolution fact. The only part of evolution that is ""theory"" is the explanation as to ""why"" it occurs. But the ""why"" has nothing to do with the simple fact that it does occur, a fact that leaves no room for creationism.

I'd love to discuss with some ID proponents what they consider to be ID's most impressive contribution to the cause.",creationism,AGAINST

By teaching creationism in the classroom, schools are broadening students' knowledge. It is possible to teach both creationism and evolution in the same school. The goal is to expose students to all widely held 'beliefs'. The path to understanding requires the teaching of both Creationism and Evolution.

Those who have it have cant help the fact that they feel an exaggerated pleasure response when they consume alcohol. Unlike alcoholics, creationists have the option to learn the truth and cure their creationism simply by reading an 8th grade science book, or attending public school. Since they refuse to inform themselves before they decide on their beliefs, they can be considered stupid.",creationism,FAVOR

It's kind of silly when you think about it. Denying nature, the creationists attempt to replace   evolution   with biblical nonsense.
