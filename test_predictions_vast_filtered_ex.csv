Tell that to my niece whose 17 month old toddler has just been diagnosed with a rare disease that will need years of medical care. Without the provisions in the new health care law, this family would be facing bankruptcy. I prefer living in a nation where we have the decency to realize that health care is a right. Obviously those who seem to be objecting to the new health care law have never faced what 30 million people face in our country every day. For them another year's delay is life or death.",FAVOR,NONE

The studies to which you refer examine calorie restriction diets, which do not work because they induce a starvation-like state that leads to metabolic changes. Changing the *types* of foods we eat is far more productive. There's evidence that eliminating wheat alone will reduce the number of calories people eat by an average of 300 a day.

Select a paper topic that you find interesting or important. Read and evaluate 10-15 reputable sources related to your topic, and then build an argument that engages with and contributes to this existing research.

Successive generations of nativists have frothed about Irish, Italians, Polish, Chinese immigrants coming to steal American jobs. Yet America has became a superpower in those years. So is immigration really killing the job market? Or maybe we should look instead at what's different now?

The inter-African and Arab slave markets (exemplified by the famous slave market of Zanzibar) had in any case been the primary destination for West African slaves since time immemorial.

However, it compounds the offense taken by foreign populations due to collateral damage (slaughtered families). The American public is then mystified as to why ""they"" hate us!

This access to information is provided not only by devices and infrastructure but also is supported by the library staff who provide invaluable assistance. They assist with the tools, and serve as guides and navigators around the rapidly growing sources and forms of online information. Looking further into the future, as educational institutions become transformed by the widespread availability of free online courses, and distributed learning becomes the norm, there is another potential role for libraries as learning centers. In this case the facility not only provides the access devices, but can also host tutors and local study groups.

Highly competitive sports really helps you learn to compete in the business world far more than those who have never been part of competitive sports can ever understand. It gives you the energy and will to compete and succeed. At my Alma-mater, student athletes have a significantly higher graduation rate than the general student body. It's no mystery as to why. You learn discipline and purpose. At my school there are many athletic facilities for those not on varsity teams that if they are out of shape, they have only themselves to blame. There is a huge variety of intramural sports, exercise facilities that include weight rooms, pools, running tracks, a golf course, etc..

First, the school board must be forgetting about the fixed costs of maintaining a library. Second, there is a complete neglect for the fact checking costs. Third, current technology costs are prohibitive; the school board's enthusiasm about the power of technology, though understandable, is misplaced. Then, there are the children themselves to be considered. What level of confidence will these children be able to have in the integrity of their resource material without a person to person interaction that will be able to uncover the specific focus and the nature of the child's, or the adolescent's, inquiry.

In such cases, the ideal treatment is psychotherapy plus antidepressant. The meds help the patient use and retain skills learned in therapy. Both, not one or the other. Also, I usually refer to knowledgeable (and kind) psychiatrist, not general practitions who may not know these drugs very well.

I don't think we'll see any real change in this country until we address issues like poverty and working conditions (including the long hours that force parents to choose between seeing their children and feeding them).

Only after I handed him a copy of Plato did he get the point.

As a student of French I have had an enormous exposure to the cultural and political issues that dominate North African, West African, and Carribean peoples. Moreover, I have been fortunate enough to gain an understanding of the American immigration debate through the comparative study of Chicano/Chicana literature juxtaposed with the literature of North African immigrants in France.

If it's the summer and you're only working at your internship part-time, you can get another job to pay your expenses.

The reason for resting disclosure is almost always: the danger presented by the hacking or the GMO. Is overblown or doesn't exist. I guess the idea is what you don't know won't hurt you. Of course we all know what you don't know can hurt you very badly.

They're amputating the toe completely so the cat has to walk on the phlanges that are NOT meant to be completely weight-bearing. A dog getting its ears or tail docked I agree is cruel but nowhere near worse than a cat being declawed. Last time I checked a dog's tail and ears aren't what bear all of their body weight when standing. Not to mention the ears are soft tissue that heals over time and has nothing to do with the dog's skeleton. The tail does involve the skeleton but would not have an effect on the dog's overall well-being once done. And excessive dog breeding?

Now I'm not proposing we abolish divorce, but I do wish evangelicals would just NOTICE that sin, if they're so determined to purify our society. But, in fact, they treat divorced people very differently from gay people, and they're not even aware of their hypocrisy. If they could accept gay congregants the way they accept divorced congregants, the world would notice that the evangelical church is no longer self-righteous and judgemental and, frankly, angry.

How is this any different than a person that invested the $50,000 into a business and then paid themselves a salary Likewise, with corporations, firms only pay taxes on their earnings. Corporations get to deduct all other expenses. So a person that owns a company could avoid the 'double taxation' issue by taking a salary instead of taking income in terms of profits.

Healthcare costs will continue to rise until a ""pay for quality and results"" model gets fully implemented. Without that these vouchers will never be allowed to grow in value equal to the healthcare inflation rate. So they will become less valuable and the poor and seniors will suffer. In an ACA-type model, or better yet, a single payer model, implemented with a solid ""pay for performance"" component, the government shoulders the burden of increasing healthcare costs, not the poorest and most vulnerable, and the government takes the responsibility of driving pricing reform because individual consumers cannot do this.",AGAINST,NONE

In doing so, I learn about things that I most likely would never discover on my own because I didn't know they existed. Much of the under 40 crowd is oblivious to my news world. They only know of news that hits their Facebook page. The news comes to them. They don't seek out the news. They are passive consumers while I am active. In doing so, the range of information they are exposed to is highly limited. This is dangerous for an open society.

Citizenship takes the universal human sense of membership in a community, and association with persons one sees every day and interacts with in many ways, and extends it in the imagination to a much larger circle, the nation. Such 'imagined community' is valuable in spurring solidarity and shared commitments beyond the local, but it is also vulnerable to emotional intensification and mythomania. The historical record of peoples subject to intense nationalist feelings -- many European nations in the 19th and early 20th century, more recently Serbia and now, more and more, China -- has been one of war-making, aggression, and disdain for others.

The same phenomenon can be observed in insects, birds, and other mammals. Displays of fitness vary, and in some it is the females rather than the males that make the displays. So -- what is wrong with it? The process is comfortably Darwinian and it has contributed to our success as a species.

So I gave in, and drink milk and eat cheese and eggs. And when I have an overwhelming desire for some meat I eat just a very small amount. Judging from my experience, I'm left with the feeling that humans should perhaps evolve biologically, slowly, and wean themselves from meat over many years. Accent plant foods and cut meat servings to half, for starters. I do believe there will come a time, perhaps 100 years from now, when humans will look back on meat eating with disgust.",FAVOR,NONE

In a border state, it was the most useful. French is not a very useful language in the US, unless you plan on working abroad or in Canada. I don't condone removing languages entirely from education (learning any language is a useful skill), but in order to make the most of a person's time and his/her desire to learn a certain language, then offer what has the highest demand, probably these days Spanish and Mandarin, the two most spoken languages globally ahead of English.

I would have been lonely off-campusin an apartment. Also, cooking, cleaning, shopping for food take time, time that I was able to devote to studying. Especially when I came back as a 26-yr old to live in a graduate dorm for a year, it was a huge relief to let someone else cook, and just show up to eat.

But what I was really enthused about was literature and writing. So I took two years off from work to go into a Masters program in English. My enthusiasm turned to repugnance when I realized that succeeding in the humanities was more about politics and high theory than a passion and a dedication to teach literature. Now I am back to working in information technology. Universities were once the gateways to information and learning. With the internet and our vast open information resources, we no longer have to pay outrageous tuition costs in order to get access to those resources and commentary on those resources. The best thing that my two years off gave me was the time to read the great works of Western culture. Unless things change in the humanities departments, I will advise my children to pursue their study of the humanities in their leisure hours.

Which is out of the price range of the majority of the country. I believe EV's are a great alternative to ICE for some people, especially people who live in urban areas.

I was fortunate to have my daughter at nearly forty, after a couple of miscarriages. One child at any age is easy enough, and she was and is a joy. Nevertheless, all her grandparents died before she was 15, and I may not live to be a grandmother myself.

It is well and good to advise patients to engage closely with their medical care, but when it is so difficult to see a doctor at all, and then be afforded only a few minutes when you do see them, I can understand why patients might seek out advice elsewhere.

China is by all accounts still very undemocratic and is fighting the tail end of a Civil War with the Chinese Nationalists with which Taiwan had very little to do, but Taiwan's future as a free and democratic nation is now being held hostage to that Civil War. The US needs to not only make the required defense articles available to Taiwan (this helps the US economy), but also retain its forward presence so it can come to the defense of Taiwan if push comes to shove. Another thing the US can do is to gr4adually move towards normalization of relations with Taiwan, and bring it into the international community as a full and equal member.

A lot of people are more interested in this kind of question than questions of real policy, because it gives them a chance to feel like an expert on the subject of politics. The obvious correct answer is no, so most people will say no. But that question is biassed by existing poll numbers. Nobody knows who can win, but everyone wants to think they know because they like predictability. Asking the question and publicizing the results plants in the people's minds the idea that a voter's judgement about whether a candidate can win or not is an important factor in voting. It isn't.

humanities departments,university humanities curriculum,"I am a physics professor at a liber I was tenured as a physics professor at a private liberal arts university about 30 years ago. Over the course of the last 15 years, new hires in physics ( and mathematics too) have been in applied, multidisciplinary fields. Unfortunately, the intellectual challenges presented to research workers in most of these areas are rather minimal. Often current applied research is based on well-understood topics in pure physics and mathematics. It's dull research for minimally-trained scientists. The main benefit to such applied fields is that the intellectual distance between the faculty and the students is narrowing. The other benefit is in grants, contracts, and patents that the military-industrial-pharmaceutical complex makes possible. Thus the faculty now trains little cogs for the benefit of the Empire. The loss of French departments and other humanities departments is just part of the reorganized modern university, which is an instrument of the modern nation state to attain greater wealth and power for some and a stultifying life for most.

The scary feature of an addiction like that is that people who have it are unaware that's what's driving their behavior and their decision making. All they know is that intensity caused by chaos makes them feel alive and good and without it they feel bored and dark and depressed. Thus, I am personally concerned that this kind of psychological issue might drive Mr. Trump to make decisions and create foreign policy he might not otherwise.

So while locked to parking signs or mailboxes in reletively short order 2 bikes were destroyed while locked up and finally after an accident with another biker which landed me in the emergency room I gave up the experiment. I am afraid my experience is not unique. I expect that unless proper parking locking facilities are provided in sufficient amount and locations the experiment will continue to serve a very small part of the population. As the accidents and injuries add up the city will eventually be forced to abandon this wasteful poorly thought out experiment..",FAVOR,NONE

Personally I would protect capital gains, dividends and interest held in retirement accounts from any taxation - and tax those outside IRAs and 401Ks at regular income rates.

The point is that Humanities constitutes windows to many areas of human thinking and accomplishment in the past and present--and that in itself is sufficient justification. The arguments put forth by Humanists in this piece are not very compelling (if that is a sign of the skills the discipline trains them for). Include some scientists in the debate to make it interdisciplinary. An important issue that has determined the desperate thinking of parents and students is that the cost of university education--even public education--has gone up enormously and the investment cost in education (for families and the state) makes them increasingly think in these narrowly pragmatic terms.

Obesity causes heart problems, diabetes onset, fallen arches (not a lightweight disability), and a variety of other problems. When I worked as a benefits administrator for a large corporation on the East Coast I saw first-hand the cost of obesity to the obese employee and to the company. Harsh as it may be, companies probably do not hire obese people if they can find a way not to. FYI: obesity does not mean plump or overweight, it means debilitating obesity. How does an obese truck driver get into the cab of his truck? At some point, he can't. How does an obese service technician get down the basement stairs in an old house? At some point he can't, especially if he is carrying his tools. And, when does an obese employee become diabetic, with all attendant problems, e.g. dead tissue on feet. Obesity is not something to defend at all costs; obesity is something to help the obese person treat and become healthy.",AGAINST,NONE

These students make the best employees. They take learning and work seriously. The problem is that graduates are now coming to the work force with far fewer skills and previous job experience than in previous generations. Many graduates have never held ANY job, be it baby sitting, dog walking or waitressing. I have found it preferable to hire graduates or students who are committed to working for more than a semester at a low wage with the understanding that due to their lack of experience, I will teach them, but they are more committed to stick around once they have learned and make great employees as their salaries go up with their abilities.",AGAINST,NONE

That's one of the things that got us into mass incarceration in the first place. A big reason why we are moving out of that period now is because various people outside the media elite who have their facts together on drug and criminal justice reform were able to use comments sections to communicate arguments about race and drug enforcement and criminal justice policy that the media status quo wasn't ready to play in prime time.

You don't turn the plant off at night just because demand is low. That's why charging cars at night makes so much sense. Secondly, if you have solar in your home, you're already providing the grid with additional clean power. I hope that green technology will go hand-in-hand with the Leaf and other electric vehicles.

I pay thousands of dollars a month in taxes for schools that I will never directly take advantage of. Shouldn't I get a tax credit? This philosophy of not paying for public services you don't directly use is poisonous. If you have a huge yard with playground equipment, should you get a tax credit for not using public parks? If you buy books instead of checking them out the library, should you get a tax credit? If you don't have a car and don't use highways, should you get a tax credit?

It is inexcusable that non-hearing children are denied sufficient education to be competent in English. In my admittedly limited experience, kids who grow up with cochlear implants and cued speech are more capable of communicating in English. For that alone it is worth it.

This is a truly regionally destabilizing possibility which would present many powers in the area with difficult potentially war causing choices. That fear draws ample support from the powers that most fear that outcome and it tends to place those resources in the hands of the most destabilizing forces in the opposition which include the most militant of islamists and those bearing the greatest ressentinent against Shiites and minority groups in Syria. The only way to stanch that flow of resources is to at least supply the most acceptable opposition forces and to marginalize the more dangerous opposition actors.

I have had a death in my practice because of a pulmonary embolus which is a risk of obesity. A few comply, get their BMI below 31 and I operate if they continue to have a favorable trajectory. I seem to be alone in this practice. One academic told me that if he discriminated against the obese ""he could not earn a living (sic!)"". I think M.D.'s are mostly in cahoots with the MacDonalds of the world in ignoring the obesity epidemic.

The Kurds are one of the few people in this region who are Western-oriented and wish to establish a democratic pluralistic society.

term limits,supreme court,"I share these concerns but I believe that the problem lies in a misalignment of the 9 justices with the body politic, and that this is the result of 30- and 40-year tenures of modern justices. The solution is term limits for justices. Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation.

Electric costs will go up.

In watching Obama's struggles with Netanyahu over the past few years, it is most striking that the leader of a foreign nation could come onto American shores and do and say the kind of things that Netanyahu has and get away with it. He can do this because he can draw on the support of a domestic constituency that Obama, apparently, cannot afford to alienate. Indeed, when we consider how much Obama has humiliated himself by backing down from his own stated positions, Mr. Miller's position becomes almost bizarre.

The motivation for immigration can vary, but poverty and lack of opportunity in the country of origin seems like its often a cause. And international policies that worsen prospects for a better life would have to be seen as a contributing factor as well. Yet, openly rewarding illegal immigrants with automatic birthright citizenship is incentivizing the disregard of the host country's own laws. This continuing conversation over immigration going on in the US, mirrors that going on in Europe today. It's the same issue. Do we fix the world first, and hope the desperation driving illegal immigration abates over time? Or absorb those flows of people from those troubled regions seeking a better life now? I think its better, and more fair to all concerned, to have a managed process for documented labor, visitation and immigration, than a mad lawless rush across borders. Civilization and civilized behavior breaks down in the face of desperation. Accepting unlimited immigrants from around the world would not improve the lives of those left behind.

In other words, the more students dislike a professor, the better those students do in similar classes down the road. Why? Because those professors challenge students to push past their comfort zones and rigid patterns of thinking.

There should be a holistic, comprehensive approach, rather than piecemeal tinkering, ranging from big-farm subsidies (sugar and corn are obvious targets) to FDA regulation to consumer purchasing.

Thus opting out, depriving schools of the funds for your enrollment, and then demanding services from them anyway, is unfair. Why did no debaters bring these up? Am I mistaken?

We stopped offering computer training because nobody showed up for these classes. We offer small business website tools that don't get used. It's great to be positive about libraries in the digital age, and certainly my job depends upon this kind of idealism. But our book circulation is down, while DVDs and video games are soaring. The fact that laptops are the highest circulated item at the author's library is probably being used more for gaming than anything else. Just sayin'...",AGAINST,NONE

Those that live locally (as opposed to those that fly in from all over the country) go home at night. Those that fly in can go or do whatever they choose after their shift is over, just like any other job. We can also refuse a client for any reason or no reason at all as well as being able tosee our own prices for any activity and change them on a whim. If there should ever be any problems (which is extrodinarilly rare because, as you mebtioned, the clients know better) response by the law is very fast.

cursive,students,"I would add that cursive is easier for students with certain disabilities to use because they are not constantly stopping and starting. The flow of cursive helped my son who suffers from a processing speed deficit that makes it hard for him to listen and write his ideas down in class.

fares,air fare,"I would agree that fares dropped between the big hubs, but for us who live in the hinterlands and have to drive 2 hours to an airport which is served by a grand total of 2 airlines, not so much. Airfares on the two airlines are always within 10 dollars of each other. The airfare for a 45 minute flight to the hub is about the same as any flight from that hub to any other destination so the end result is flying costs twice as much than if you flew from a hub. The end result is the hub and spoke system results in lower fares where there is competition and a virtual oligopoly at the end of each spoke. Granted, it is not a monopoly which would cause scrutiny, but the airlines collusion acts like one. Add to that, most of the flying public knows what happens with a weather related problem at a hub. The ripple effects throughout the system impact much more than just one hub. Sorry, deregulation resulted in much higher fares and much worse service when weather intervenes.",AGAINST,NONE

(I would, however, understand if beachfront owners pushed for strict rules concerning the use of those beaches: curfews, open container rules, and that sort of thing). .

Right now, we talk about everyone voting, as if it was some kind of religious ritual like the Sabbath or Ramadhan. But voting is not a religious ritual, it is participation in government making. And those who do not read newspapers and do not understand the issues, should preferably not vote. I know my point of view is unusual, in a society where voting is regarded as a kind of party - the more the better. But perhaps this is an area where skill matters. If most voters had graduated from college, I doubt that we would see Cain or Perry as viable candidates.

If someone attends community college and achieves a 3.0 GPA there, they should be able to transfer to a 4 year college and have the remainder of that paid for them. If a kid can't achieve the levels for free tuition at a university or community college, they can still pay to attend. Maybe they'll prove everyone wrong. It's vitally important to the country that all our smart and studious kids who want it, can choose higher education, no matter their means. Whatever we would spend on tuition for the 3.0 GPA students, we would gain back many times over.

I find it offensive to come to a place like Sea Ranch, and find that all the pullouts along highway 1 in this area, from where one can walk to the beach, require you to pay a fee to park. So, unless you are traveling the highway without a car, there is no way to access the beach at Sea Ranch without paying a fee. THis should be forbidden. In my view, we should also prevent people from being able to buy land within a certain distance of the water in areas that remain undeveloped, in order to better preserve these undeveloped areas.",AGAINST,NONE

This turned out not to be possible because none of the certified nurse midwives in town were willing to attend a home birth, and I wanted a midwife with at least that level of training. Instead, I went to the hospital, where my husband functioned very effectively as my midwife for 4 of my 5 hours of labor. The midwife appeared within an hour of the birth and was busy gathering supplies when the baby was born, so I caught him myself. After filling out paperwork, the midwife left and I literally never heard from her again. No MD was ever involved. For this birth, the charge was over $3,000. Welcome to America.",AGAINST,NONE

There's way too much control not only of the economy but of the politics when banks get as powerful as the two he references. Furthermore, I suspect that if those giant banks were broken up, smaller more local/regional banks would hire every one of those employed by JPMorgan, Citi, Wells Fargo, etc. Not only that, but their economies of scale actually reduce the total potential employees mini-banks would need to operate.

Nowadays, a quick Google Image search on my mom's part could have convinced him to go much earlier. Doctors deal with people's health all day long and know a lot, but patients and their loved ones are the experts on what is normal for them and are the ones who know when something just doesn't seem right.

If we are going to subsidize preschool or child care, why not also subsidize parents who want to stay home with their children but can't afford to? We are constantly being urged to copy European measures to provide care for children outside the home, but we are never urged to follow the example of Finland, France, Norway, Belgium and Austria by also providing parental home-care allowances. Why the selectivity? I am afraid it is because while feminism claims to oppose our tendency to hold the work of childcare in low regard - a tendency which predates second-wave feminism - it has done virtually nothing to correct that prejudice. Instead it supports an everybody-into-the-workforce ideology which in turn relies on the availability of underpaid childcare.",AGAINST,NONE

For example, I recently had a number of blood tests run and the results emailed to me. I have no idea what the results mean and emailed my doctor to ask what behavioural changes I would need to make to be healthier. I was told that my results indicate that I am health and to eat a low GI diet.

If one has a permit to carry a pistol or revolver, then, it is assumed, one has passed various ""tests and inspections"" to be allowed to do the same.

affirmative action,affirmative actions,"I would support the idea of class-based vs. race-based admission affirmative action in college admissions. If it is true that race is a large factor in economic disadvantage and denied opportunities, then class based AA will address that. Otherwise, it creates more discrimination based on race, and assumptions (fair or not) that a student got in only because of race. While Texas does many things wrong, their 10% rule for the top two universities generally addresses this. It is very transparent, and everyone knows the expectation going in. The AA idea based on race is in itself racist, since it assumes that race alone is a factor in ability and achievement. As an example, if my child was 1/16 Chickasaw instead of 1/32 Chickasaw, he could have received a full ride. It has nothing to do with character, academic ability, or income.

As much as I believe that good measurement of performance is very valuable to faculty members, I also believe that much of this measurement is done carelessly and unscientifically. Consequently, you are more likely to see extreme results and some that do not make the intended sense at all. One of the best compliments I received from a student was in the form of what he or she must have thought to be highly critical, and I quote: ""The worst teacher I have ever had.

I haven't smoked in since. These changes in usage had to do with availability and (mostly) social circumstances. (I didn't begin to crave it more; I gradually lost interest as the novelty wore off.) Marijuana in those days was very much a social drug; I smoked it alone just once in my life. I wouldn't even say that stopping and starting was easy; it was nothing whatsoever. I never encountered anyone at any time in my life who showed the slightest sign of being even slightly addicted. (I do know what addiction is.

There is no enmity between the sciences and the humanities. They are richly complementary. Anecdote: For some reason, when I was an undergraduate classics major, some of the most well-rounded, thinking students I knew were geology majors. Why geology? Not sure. Maybe because it was West Virginia, where mineral wealth had long been exploited by out-of-state corporations. These geology maors, who were preparing themselves with the scientific understanding to deal with mineral managements, were also intellectually engaged in a most vivid way with their classics and philosophy classes. So the argument isn't necessarily that French departments, or classics or Russian, are there to produce an army of majors. (Just enough to keep the discipline alive.)

A piece of ""criticism"" is worthwhile not because of its particular opinion, but because it is entertaining, provocative, and illuminating not just of the particular work but of the work's place in a larger historical, artistic and social context. Ultimately, any ""critic"" stands or falls on self-revelation: the subject under scrutiny is as much his or her particular prejudices, enthusiasms and acuity as the work under discussion. Professional critics are crucial to cultural vitality in many ways - as champions of unfamiliar works, as stimulators of curiosity, as goads to clearer, deeper thinking about an artistic experience, to name a few.

Some aspects tat often accompany these attributes are completely counterproductive. Children must learn how to make good decisions and recover from mistakes. This requires practice, which means they must be allowed to make decisions and experience the consequences thereof. Children must learn to deal with others, including the range of personalities and opinions that exist in the society around them. Isolating them will not achieve this. People are more effective and successful when they are able to work and live in a way that is consistent with their talents and motivaitons.

New York, for example, turning into an outlandishly expensive and impervious island of wealth. As service providers, both blue and white collar, are driven further and further from the center they find it necessary to commute inward by automobile. Automobiles are resisted by the wealthy center as ugly noisy dispensers of pollution and pedestrian risk. Even the NY public transit system is quite unable to overcome the need for commuting by personal vehicle. This is clearly pushing to unsustainability.

The restaurant owners benefits from tipping come, in the end, at the worker's expense. Tipping is a form of corruption and would certainly not be tolerated in businesses like teaching, architecture, healthcare, journalism, etc. Tipping gives a financial reward to the stingy at the expense of the generous, undermines union organizing and dramatically decreases the transparency of compensation. The sooner tipping ends, the better for working people. It will be tough for restaurant owners and managers.

I'm sympathetic and agree that service staff are often underpaid, and I agree that the minimum wage is too low. However, it's not that clear to me why a waiter who works at a swanky restaurant making $30 / hour in tips should be federally guaranteed an extra $2.13 per hour on top of their minimum wage.

Similarly, Lance Armstrong didn't win all those Tour victories as a vegan. I'd be interested to know when the other athletes Rip mentioned became vegans. I'd bet it was long after they had become champions. In any case, for every vegan elite athlete Rip names, I can name a couple hundred omnivorous ones. So despite these examples, it is entirely possible -- and likely -- that any vegan athlete who reaches elite levels is a fluke and became a champion IN SPITE OF his/her nutritionally deficient vegan diet, and NOT because of it.

Most of the issues facing the millennials result from the choices they have made over the course of their lives. Too bad they don't have truly serious issues facing them, like the possibility of being drafted and sent off to fight America's overseas wars. There's an example of somebody else making a choice for you that you have absolutely no choice in the matter, other than defying the law, going to prison (like Muhammad Ali), or leaving the country.

Markets are in general very good at coordinating supply and demand and allocating capital but markets only work if economic actors both receive the benefits but also bear the costs of their business decisions. Regulations, however imperfect, are necessary because, in many circumstances economic actors receive the profits but do not pay the costs of their activity. In such circumstances it is rational for a firm maximize its profits while ignoring the costs, however large, of its business activities. If there were no emissions regulations, including penalties for violating, those regulations, VW would face no financial fallout.

University has become very expensive and middle-class families should not be running up the bill by sending students away to school.

I can say from experience that it's a far better screening tool than a job interview, and worth every penny. I think unpaid internships are fine, but in limited circumstances--for example, if the student is still in college and can get academic credit. In this case, though, you'd want to make sure that the student is getting training and is not forced to do menial tasks. I had some internships like this in college and they were very beneficial. I also think that non-profit organizations should be able to offer limited unpaid internships. In all other circumstances, internships should be paid, and interns should at least receive minimum wage.

The overseeing organization realized that excluding homeschoolers was indeed discriminatory, and set about creating a system within which they could participate. In other states, there are laws on the books that require schools to allow homeschoolers to participate in school activities. My daughter was very involved in sports, and very talented at it, and she took advantage of both elite leagues and her high school teams (she was an enrolled student, not a homeschooler). The elite leagues are available to those who can make the teams, true, and most serious athletes participate in them.

Fifty years ago migrant crews were blacks who followed the harvest seasons up and down the East coast. With liberal welfare policies they could stay in one place. Farmers who still needed workers came to depend on contractors who would supply illegals. Forcing blacks off of welfare and busing them to farm jobs would probably not go over very well. Simply enforcing labor laws prohibiting hiring of illegals is not good enough. They have to be kept out of the country.

Moreover, the appearance of impropriety is often as corrosive of public trust as actual impropriety or criminality.

Such advocacy doesn't direct benefit the children they taught, but it will benefit public education. TFA recognizes that we need to change the political debate over public education as much as we need to get top graduates into schools as teachers.

It's really disheartening listening to a kid tell you that, despite many uncles, aunts and cousins, they have ""a small family"", because they have no grandparents... How they wish they knew those grandparents, and wonder what they were like. Beyond covering the basics, money doesn't matter so much to kids, nor does status, nor material things nor travel, but what does matter to them is the people around them. There are all kinds of reasons to delay, but among the ""know what you're doing if you delay"" advice, I think the social circle a child is born into should take high priority - both in terms of the grandparents they may not have, and in terms of the parents who may not even live to see that child graduate from college...",AGAINST,NONE

Within about 15 minutes of the story being released, commenters were putting up links to stories about Bernie Sanders visiting New York's public housing projects about 10 hours earlier, a rebuttal that many readers might have been unaware of had the comment section not existed.

marijuana,marijuana,"The author here misses the point. Marijuana is massively more popular than any other drug, with something like 1 in three Americans admit to having tried it at least once. Heroin is more like 1 in 100. The way this actually works is: Most people try Marijuana before anything else. The vast majority of them do not go on to anything else, but of those who do, Marijuana preceded. By analogy - riding motorcycles is very dangerous and relatively few people do it. Bicycle riding us much easier and safer, and most people ride a bicycle before they get on a motorcycle. Does it make sense to ban bicycles in order to prevent the harms of motorcycle riding? The problem here is that the correlation goes the other way. Being a habitual Heroin user makes it more likely that you've used Marijuana. That doesn't mean that smoking Marijuana makes you more likely to go on to harder drugs. Ask how many of your friends who smoke Marijuana have ever done Heroin. The answer is tiny.

Both metro areas have good public transit, and getting better. Even if LA's is not currently much used by upper middle class riders, these are not the only people we care about. Moreover, he is badly mistaken when he says that a high-speed rail service ""doesn't touch the huge mass of traffic, which swirls daily in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas."" Intercity rail and local transit are mutually supportive. Predictably, if high speed trains arrive in downtown LA, more people will use the red, gold and other rail lines to reach their trains than currently do to get to LAX. On the contrary, shifting intercity travel preferences has great potential, especially over time, to shift local travel preferences. Without knowing the author's work, I would further point out that Stanford's record on the study of high speed rail is weak, and that Stanford's professors have been numerous (if short-sighted) in protesting a high-speed rail service that they - probably mistakenly - see as negatively impacting their quality of life.

The issues are whether California and the U.S. controls the borders and whether it enforces it's laws about immigrant and working in the state remain in no way resolved. Children who identify as Americans but who never were naturalized live in a strange condition which leaves them less than fully enfranchised and legally subject to deportation and unable to act as any another American is entitled.

Give it a couple of centuries of that policy and it could rise humanity's (at least in the western world) life expectancy by raising, among others, our reproductive expectancy.",FAVOR,NONE

poll,using polls,"This response reflects my views as well. Polls are a political tool for politicians, not a democratic vehicle where people can voice their opinions and know that it will matter. It is much easier for a pollster to get a higher rate of return with simple questions that require yes/no answers. Thus, should an interviewer encounter someone with a more nuanced view or deeper understanding, those responses are far less likely to be included, let alone even documented. Interviewers generally get paid by the number of completed surveys. Thus polls would tend to reflect the attitude of the least educated and least critical thinkers among us. Sorry if that sounds condescending. By then reflecting - after the usually poorly worded and biases questions are asked - those opinions, the polls then contribute to the dumbing down of America.",FAVOR,NONE

Otherwise cases of a lethal form of dengue fever could increase. The paper does not state that releasing GM mosquitos actually makes matters worse in a general sense. In fact, the modeling presented in the paper shows that combining the two approaches (vaccination and GMO release) reduce both types of dengue fever, much more than one or the other treatment used alone.

One important capability of 3D printing, is to enable continuous innovations. Yet, as aptly pointed out by the author, traditional manufacturing still holds an important place in the business world. Once products are developed, it is challenging for 3D printers to match the economies of scale available through traditional manufacturing. The main advantage of 3D printing is enabling of low cost rapid prototypes , as compared to traditional manufacturing, which typically requires higher volumes to lower costs. 3D printing will potentially have a greater impact on the world over the next 20 years than all of the innovations from the industrial revolution combined.

Instruction would include: libraries, technology in classrooms, faculty salaries, advising etc. Administrative salaries, fancy food courts, fancy health clubs and the endless numbers of Vice Presidents would be excluded from Instructional Costs. I am a faculty member at public university and I have not had a raise in almost 8 years.

When I press on further and ask about female genital mutilation, which IS practiced in certain cultural/religious cultures today, I am met with silence. My point is that there are limits to religious freedom even if we don't codify them. These limits seem to be that religious freedom ends when harm to others starts and no amount of sincere, passionate belief in some deity can overcome them.

Tenure keeps those arbitrary firings from happening in the first place, while allowing administrators to fire bad teachers where there's actually a reason to do so.
