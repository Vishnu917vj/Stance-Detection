Successive generations of nativists have frothed about Irish, Italians, Polish, Chinese immigrants coming to steal American jobs. Yet America has became a superpower in those years. So is immigration really killing the job market? Or maybe we should look instead at what's different now?

But when they discontinued their part in the trade, and actively (in the case of Britain) sought to suppress it, there was an angry reaction from the indigenous rulers of West Africa, because slavery was the mainstay of their economies. The trade continued unabated (if perhaps less lucratively), as slaves were sold to the North African and Arab states, right up to the 1960s. The inter-African and Arab slave markets (exemplified by the famous slave market of Zanzibar) had in any case been the primary destination for West African slaves since time immemorial.

Also, I usually refer to knowledgeable (and kind) psychiatrist, not general practitions who may not know these drugs very well.

Moreover, I have been fortunate enough to gain an understanding of the American immigration debate through the comparative study of Chicano/Chicana literature juxtaposed with the literature of North African immigrants in France.

timing of parenting,motherhood,"I agree with many of the posters: there is no one 'right' decision about the timing of parenting. That said, and based on my own experience, I would still encourage young women to have their babies on the younger side, if they have a choice. Late twenties seems optimal. I was fortunate to have my daughter at nearly forty, after a couple of miscarriages. One child at any age is easy enough, and she was and is a joy. Nevertheless, all her grandparents died before she was 15, and I may not live to be a grandmother myself. Also, although I would have dearly loved a second child, I didn't think I had the energy for two. Parenting has been one of my life's greatest blessings, and I am grateful for the child I had. Nevertheless, having babies younger presents richer possibilities all the way around.",FAVOR,FAVOR,FAVOR

The US needs to not only make the required defense articles available to Taiwan (this helps the US economy), but also retain its forward presence so it can come to the defense of Taiwan if push comes to shove. Another thing the US can do is to gr4adually move towards normalization of relations with Taiwan, and bring it into the international community as a full and equal member.

Asking the question and publicizing the results plants in the people's minds the idea that a voter's judgement about whether a candidate can win or not is an important factor in voting. It isn't.

parking lock,biking feasibility,"I bike regularly as exercise and have experimented with the city's initiative , attempting to bike to work. My commute is not long, from the west 100's to 60th st and Madison and so can even take advantage of central park as well as the bike lanes. I soon found that on the rare occasions when I could bike successfully without some heart stopping near or actual accident which most often caused by pedestrians not looking at bike lanes, that when I did arrive at my destination there were few if any places to lock my bike. So while locked to parking signs or mailboxes in reletively short order 2 bikes were destroyed while locked up and finally after an accident with another biker which landed me in the emergency room I gave up the experiment. I am afraid my experience is not unique. I expect that unless proper parking locking facilities are provided in sufficient amount and locations the experiment will continue to serve a very small part of the population. As the accidents and injuries add up the city will eventually be forced to abandon this wasteful poorly thought out experiment..",AGAINST,AGAINST,FAVOR
capital gains,invest,"I can have all sorts of long and short term capital gains within my regular IRA and tax rates on them are bupkis until I either roll over money to a Roth or withdraw from my IRA - which money (including gains) is then taxed like regular income. Conversely, gains in a mature Roth IRA aren't taxed when I eventually draw down from that account. Personally I would protect capital gains, dividends and interest held in retirement accounts from any taxation - and tax those outside IRAs and 401Ks at regular income rates. Interest earned on FDIC protected savings accounts of $250K or under (the account balance, NOT $250K in interest) should also be exempt, and above that fully taxable.

We have a way to go before celebrating full equality. Women make about 20% less than men, and are still mostly the ones directly responsible for child and elder care. We elected a black male president before a female one, and one sitting senator recently advised a female colleague ""not to lose too much weight."" since he liked his women curvy. Ambitious women are still perceived as ""pushy,"" and continue having trouble with that glass ceiling. We talk too much at corporate meetings and also too little.

cursive writing,students,"I once got a summer job near the House of Seven Gables, in Salem, in the hall of records, deciphering and keying in old deed books, from the 1700's. At the end of the summer, they threw away my work, because no one had the patience to read ancient cursive and copy it, when they realized they could instead just scan. Cursive writing, through most of history, was very far removed from your beautiful, cherished, letters. It was used by underpaid recorders, of other people's transactions. The novelty of the letter 's' written as 'f', etc., wears off quickly. However, Kate Gladstone's arguments for teaching children to read cursive, and to write hybrid, which takes little time, can confer big benefits later in life.

A side benefit is that they can appreciate cursive, and the history it sometimes cradles.",FAVOR,FAVOR,FAVOR

Clearly ""the meaning of sex and marriage within the cosmic order"" in relationships within the Bible itself was changeable. It seems an odd thing to hold ""the meaning of sex and marriage within the cosmic order"" to be fixed and unalterable now when it was not so in the past, and it is needlessly cruel to use this concept as a means of hurting loving, committed same-sex couples.",AGAINST,AGAINST,AGAINST

Tenure keeps those arbitrary firings from happening in the first place, while allowing administrators to fire bad teachers where there's actually a reason to do so. It's stupidly simple: tenure is basically a law that says teachers, after several years of service, need to be informed of the reason they're being fired and given a chance to respond to those accusations.

justice ginzberg,elections,why are we having this discussion . Americans shouldn't be criticizing Justice Ginznerg about anything she says or thinks . All true thinking and caring Americans should feel insulted that she should be placed in this position . What Americans need to be concerned about is that fake and stupid gop presumptive nominee maybe will be our president ! That is the real problem . What a nightmare we have placed ourselves in . When will real truth justice and American way be ours again ? I want justice Ginzberg to speak the truth any time she wants . And that other one who will not be named should just go away .,AGAINST,FAVOR,FAVOR
