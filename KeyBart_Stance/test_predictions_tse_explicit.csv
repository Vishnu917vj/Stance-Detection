christians,AGAINST,"It is not 'appropriate' to teach creationism as a means for upholding the bible. This pre-supposes that the bible should be upheld in a literal sense. Many Christians object to this. More importantly, governments should not be in the business of upholding the Bible.
",creationism,AGAINST
christians,AGAINST,"The point of the debate is to set up a straw man, that the world was created in six days, that anti-Christians can knock down. The Bible doesn't stand or fall on that statement. Creationism doesn't stand or fall on that statement. God did not create the world in six days, but he did never the less, create it.",creationism,AGAINST
christians,AGAINST," Allowing creationism in schools would violate the separation of church and state A separation of Church and state necessitates that public schools not be a forum for upholding the validity or truth of certain faiths. This does not necessarily mean that Christian faith and ""creationism"" should not be taught as subjects of interest in public schools. 
",creationism,AGAINST
evolution,AGAINST," Evolution is a theory that is supported at the micro level.  The macro level of evolution has a long way to go to provide proof, but there is enough work going on in this subject that links can eventually be found.  Creationism is also a theory based on faith, yes there are some historical evidence of links to the stories within the Bible, but that only proves that the Bible has some historical value and does not prove the Creationism theory.",creationism,FAVOR
evolutionism,AGAINST,"Preventing creationism to be taught is not violating freedom of religion. Evolutionism is not a religion, and therefore renders this argument void.
",creationism,AGAINST
creationism,FAVOR," Creationism is scientifically testable. Some creationists have argued that 'creationism' is a theory consistent with the scientific method. The hypothesis it adopts is that God created 'the heaven and earth ...' some thousands of years ago, and that man did not ""evolve"" into his current state. Supporters of Creationism then cite supporting evidence for this theory.
",creationism,AGAINST
evolution,FAVOR,evolution has never been proven and will never be proven because it never happened. on that note you also can't prove creationism ever took place because it just happened. there is nothing intelligent about the thought you evolved from hydrogen gas or any other non living thing.,creationism,AGAINST
evolution,AGAINST,"Contrary to some belief, Evolution doesn't conflict with creationism~You just have to read the first story of the bible, Adam and Eve, in a less literal sense.",creationism,AGAINST
creationism,FAVOR,"Teaching Creationism is in no way akin to child abuse. Does Richard Dawkins give any support for his claim? Any reason he believes this to be so? It is hard to refute an argument that states ungrounded opinion as fact, but even harder to take it seriously.
",creationism,AGAINST
evolution,FAVOR,"Attempts to conceal the creationism-evolution controversy from students are dogmatic promotions of evolution. Not since blasphemy laws has competitive expression of thought been illegalized, and this is what evolutionists want to accomplish. This is evidenced by none other than the title of an evolutionist argument on this very page: ""Schools should not teach theories that are completely at odds with each other""
",creationism,AGAINST
creationism,FAVOR,Now creationism to me makes much more sense... Evolution is a theory that has not been proven and i think probably never will be...I have never seen an ape evolve into a human and although i have never seen god that makes more sense then evolution.,creationism,FAVOR
creationism,AGAINST," Public opinion is unimportant to whether creationism belongs in science classes - Public opinion does not determine whether creationism qualifies as science. This is the primary question surrounding whether it belongs in the classroom, so public opinion should not have any place in this debate. 
",creationism,FAVOR
creationism,AGAINST," You're right, there isn't a shred of positive evidence for creationism and creationists don't even try.  All they do is try to poke holes in evolution as if that does anything whatsoever to prove creationism is at all viable.  />   /> You have to remember that the majority of ""professional creationists"" are just shysters trying to make a buck out of people's religious gullibility.",creationism,AGAINST
creationism,FAVOR,"The problem with the Catholic Church is that it has been unable to disagree with any scientific theory ever since they got burned condemning Galileo. The problem over ID is more semantic than real. In   science   God is the Unified Force, ID is Chaos Theory. You can teach Creationism or ID in the public schools you just have to call it Chaos Theory.",creationism,AGAINST
creationism,FAVOR,"Laurie Goodstein. ""Teaching of Creationism Is Endorsed in New Survey"" August 31, 2005
",creationism,FAVOR
evolution,AGAINST,"Scientific subjects such as the creation and development of the universe aren't really democratic topics. Just because some smart people who believe in evolution are outnumbered by an army of morons who believe in creationism, doesn't give creationism any more validity. Those who believe in creationism when there is clear, scientific evidence against it are either ignorant to the theory of evolution or stupid. But those who continue to believe in creationism despite having access to the truth (like in America) are surely stupid.",creationism,AGAINST
creationism,FAVOR,"""Proof Why Creationism Should Be Taught In Schools"". Catholic Online. September 7th, 2005
",creationism,FAVOR
evolution,AGAINST,"Evolution has been basically proven... Other than that, the only source for creationism is the creation story in the Bible. And although that's a nice story and all, I believe it was only put there as an allegory for other messages we should know, like ""God is all powerful (He created everything)"" and ""God is all loving (the line ""and He saw it was good"")"".",creationism,AGAINST
creationism,FAVOR," Devil's advocate: Creationism is true because Creation (the world) exists, and the Bible exists in it, and the Bible confirms Creationism. So we have the world and the Bible as two data points drawing a straight line back to Creationism.   />   /> Nobel Prize, please!!",creationism,AGAINST
creationism,AGAINST," Teaching creationism is dangerous to science and reason - If a theory that does not follow the scientific method is taught in schools as ""science"", science and reasoning will be undermined.
",creationism,FAVOR
evolution,FAVOR,"It's called the THEORY of evolution for a reason. Do you know why? Because it's not the LAW of evolution because it has no proof! Even IF evolution was truth(which it isn't) it doesn't proove against intelligent design. Intelligent design constitutes that something created the universe; Aithiesm constitutes that NOTHING created the universe.Personally, I believe that the earth and universe was created in six literal days, and evolution has no more proof than creationism IMHO",creationism,AGAINST
evolution,AGAINST," Evolution is an observable fact - While creationists often attempt to describe evolution as merely a theory, this is not exactly the case. Observations that evolution does occur in nature makes the process of evolution fact. The only part of evolution that is ""theory"" is the explanation as to ""why"" it occurs. But the ""why"" has nothing to do with the simple fact that it does occur, a fact that leaves no room for creationism. 
",creationism,AGAINST
intelligent design creationism,AGAINST,"--PaulUnfortunately, a review of the entire corpus of actual scientific journal articles reveals an inconvenient truth: The so-called empirical scientific truths of intelligent design creationism seem to be entirely missing.---Of course, since ID makes no scientifically relevant positive predictions relevant to intelligent design, it is not surprising that the 'best' of ID is still ranking as mediocre in science. I'd love to discuss with some ID proponents what they consider to be ID's most impressive contribution to the cause.",creationism,AGAINST
creationism,FAVOR,"Teaching the creationism-evolution controversy is important to student learning. - One of the greatest lessons that a school can teach its students is the ability to use their own logic and reasoning to develop an objective opinion of the world around them. By teaching creationism in the classroom, schools are broadening students' knowledge. It is possible to teach both creationism and evolution in the same school. The goal is to expose students to all widely held 'beliefs'. The path to understanding requires the teaching of both Creationism and Evolution. 
",creationism,FAVOR
alcoholism,AGAINST,"Alcoholism is a disease. Those who have it have cant help the fact that they feel an exaggerated pleasure response when they consume alcohol. Unlike alcoholics, creationists have the option to learn the truth and cure their creationism simply by reading an 8th grade science book, or attending public school. Since they refuse to inform themselves before they decide on their beliefs, they can be considered stupid.",creationism,FAVOR
creationism,AGAINST,"""The dangers of creationism in education"". Council of Europe. 8 June 2007
",creationism,AGAINST
evolution,AGAINST," God does exist, he created evolution... Maybe evolution did occur (scientific proof says it does), however God created it. There is proof God exists, and proof creationism occurred... So I run with both sides... Until more proof unearths itself.",creationism,FAVOR
creationism,FAVOR,"The history of God's creation should be taught irrespective of it being considered ""science"". Why does creationism have to be considered ""scientific"" to be taught? Spirituality and God's role in creating the world (or even just the possibility of this) are all highly important to understand by students, and should therefore be taught.
",creationism,FAVOR
hypnosis,AGAINST,"""PS INCLUDING CREATIONISM AS A N OPTION AND STOPPING HYPNOSIS ON STUDENTS WOULD BRING UP THEIR IQ'S IMMEDIATELY! ""If we include   creationism   we should include all the creationist stories... the proof is about equal for all of them.And really... the hypnosis bit again???",creationism,AGAINST
creationism,AGAINST,"Intelligent Design is a dishonest way for   creationism   to try to appear scientific.  It's kind of silly when you think about it. Denying nature, the creationists attempt to replace   evolution   with biblical nonsense.  They pretend that some bodiless ghost is the cause of everything in the universe and conceal their beliefs behind a psuedo-scientific cloak of ""intelligent design.""",creationism,AGAINST
creationism,AGAINST,To each their own as a personal belief I have nothing against those that subscribe to creationism but feel strongly that it does not belong in schools. There is no theory of creation it is not even a hypothesis it is a belief or faith. Given the current state of education I dont think america can afford to put faith in schools.,creationism,AGAINST
creationism,AGAINST," There's no rational reason to accept creationism, it's simply empty claims with no evidence, it has no predictive powers, it cannot explain what we see in nature and it introduces a level of complexity with no explanation, requiring mindless faith. How anyone with half a brain can accept creationism is beyond me.",creationism,AGAINST
teaching creationism,AGAINST,"Teaching creationism is akin to child-abuse. This view is put forward by Richard Dawkins, a prominent opponent of teaching creationism in schools.
",creationism,AGAINST
evolution,FAVOR," Granted creationism is not provable through the use of the scientific method.  This does not mean it is false.  Evolution (life arising from nonlife or nothingness) is also not provable through the scientific method.  Both are speculation on the part of the person that believes them to be true.    />   /> And haters, don't bother commenting on how science has proven evolution through the fossil record or the fact that species change through natural selection because neither of those contradict creationism.",creationism,AGAINST
creationism,AGAINST,Um this thread is months old and no one is reading it.  Email me if you want more.  But Pandas proves it all by itself.  Creationism is religious.  Pandas is creationism.  Game over.,creationism,AGAINST
creationism,AGAINST,"If creationism should be taught, it should not be taught in science classes. Opponents point out that there is no scientific controversy, but only a political and religious one, therefore ""teaching the controversy"" would only be appropriate in a social studies, religion, or philosophy class.
",creationism,AGAINST
creationism,FAVOR, Creationism is mythology and intelligent design is a politically based movement to secure the support of a certain segment of the population. Not nonsense just nothing particularly to do with the truth.,creationism,AGAINST
flat earthism,AGAINST,"Teaching creationism is comparable to teaching flat earthism. The scientific consensus against creationism is as strong as against ""flat earthism"". ""Flat earthism"" would never be taught today as a legitimate theory. Therefore, neither should creationism be taught as a theory explaining the origin of the earth. This view is put forward by Richard Dawkins, a prominent opponent of teaching creationism in schools.
",creationism,AGAINST
creation science,AGAINST,"As much as I might believe that there is some sort of creator and that a creation occurred, you cannot justifiably intermingle science and religion. ID is just ""creation science"" (which is not science at all) in disguise!Teach science, not religion, in the science classroom, and creationism/ID in church. Bottom line, end of story.
